After a conversation I had at the [SMTPB conference at NIMPB](https://www.nitmb.org/modeling-and-theory-in-population-biology), I decided to revisit an old, unpublished result from my senior thesis about a coexistence criteria in the replicator equation. While the classical text of Hofbauer and Sigmund covers many related results, I have not found this specific coexistence criteria in the literature, and think it has an interesting, biologically interpretable form. If you come across this and have any comments, please feel free to reach out to me!
