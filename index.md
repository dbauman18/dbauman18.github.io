# Hi, I'm Daniel. 

I'm a third PhD student working on mathematical biology at Stanford University. I am coadvised by [Noah Rosenberg](https://rosenberglab.stanford.edu/) and [Ben Good](https://bgoodlab.github.io/). My current research focuses on **statistics of phylogenetic tree shape** and **population genetics in metapopulations**.
