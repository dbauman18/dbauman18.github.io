# Hi, my name is Daniel Bauman.

I'm a third year PhD student in the [Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, coadvised by [Noah Rosenberg](https://rosenberglab.stanford.edu/) and [Ben Good](https://bgoodlab.github.io/). My current research focuses on **statistics of phylogenetic tree shape** and **population genetics in metapopulations**. Broadly, I am fascinated by questions at the intersection of mathematics with evolution and ecology.

You can find out more about my [projects](publications.md) and read my [blog](blog/index.md), where I write about mathematics, some adventures in nature, and more! For fun, I enjoy backpacking, fly fishing, looking for salamanders and more.

x &= 3 - 1 \\
&= 2
